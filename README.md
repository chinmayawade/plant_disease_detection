Plant Disease Detection using resMLP Feed-Forward Networks for Image Classification.
ResMLP, also known as the Residual Multi-layer Perceptron, is a neural network architecture that has shown promising results in various computer vision tasks. To use ResMLP for plant disease detection, we can follow the following steps:

Collect and preprocess the dataset: Collect a large dataset of images of healthy and diseased plants, and preprocess them by resizing, cropping, and normalizing the images.

Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

Train the ResMLP model: Initialize the ResMLP model and train it using the training set. During training, use data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation to increase the robustness of the model.

Tune hyperparameters: Tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs using the validation set to improve the performance of the model.

Evaluate the model: Finally, evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set by calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Overall, ResMLP can be a powerful tool for plant disease detection, but the quality and size of the dataset, as well as the effectiveness of the data preprocessing and augmentation, can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.
